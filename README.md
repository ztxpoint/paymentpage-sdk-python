## Installation

Install with pip
```bash
pip install ztxpoint-sdk
```

### Get URL for payment

```python
from payment_page_sdk.gate import Gate
from payment_page_sdk.payment import Payment

gate = Gate('secret')
payment = Payment('402')
payment.payment_id = 'some payment id'
payment.payment_amount = 1001
payment.payment_currency = 'USD'
base_url = 'http://your_pp_url'
payment_url = gate.get_purchase_payment_page_url(base_url, payment)
# payment_url = gate.get_purchase_payment_page_url(base_url, payment, 'encryption_key') - for necrypted url
``` 
Для шифрования урла желательно использовать ключ не менее 16 символов.
В случае, если потребуется шифрование урла, то будет необходимо установить библиотеку pycryptodome 

```
pip install pycryptodome
```

`payment_url` here is the signed URL.

### Handle callback

You'll need to autoload this code in order to handle notifications:

```python
from payment_page_sdk.gate import Gate

gate = Gate('secret')
callback = gate.handle_callback(data)
```

`data` is the JSON data received from payment system;

`callback` is the Callback object describing properties received from payment system;
`callback` implements these methods: 
1. `callback.get_payment_status()`
    Get payment status.
2. `callback.get_payment()`
    Get all payment data.
3. `callback.get_payment_id()`
    Get payment ID in your system.
